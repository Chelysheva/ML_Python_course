# Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn (3 sessions)
## Tutor: Dr Irina Chelysheva. Contacts: Oxford profile, Twitter

In this short series we will get familiar with the most common Machine Learning algorithms and apply them in Python, using scikit-learn and beyond. We will perform end-to-end ML projects for various data types and research questions. We will select the best ML method by evaluating their performance, use feature selection approaches, apply cross-validation and make the actual predictions. For those previously participating in the first two sessions – new(!) third session will be covering unsupervised ML methods and their applications.


## Topics to be covered

- Overview of ML methods and algorithms, unsupervised vs supervised learning

- Evaluation of the performance of the algorithms and the choice of the best one

- Application of ML to different problems – classification vs regression, different types of data

- Hands-on end-to-end ML analysis in Python with sklearn

- Feature selection methods and their application

- Metrics and evaluation of the performance – using cross-validation and making further predictions



## Learning Objectives:

- perform end-to-end machine learning analysis of the dataset using Python;

- select the best machine learning algorithm for particular dataset;

- apply ML methods to both regression and classification problems;

- perform the feature selection;

- make the predictions and evaluate the performance of the ML algorithms
